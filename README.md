## 📖 About Me
I’m a cloud-first data engineer in training and a pragmatist by habit.  
At Capgemini, I ran large fleets of databases and servers, wired up pipelines that actually ship, and cut toil with IaC.  
At SBU, I’m sharpening the theory that makes models behave and systems scale.

- 🧰 Managed **75+** Azure SQL & AWS RDS instances (backup, performance, HA/DR).
- ⚙️ Shipped IaC for **50+** Windows/Linux servers with Terraform + Ansible via Azure DevOps.
- 🛠️ Operated **15+** ETL/ELT pipelines on GCP (Airflow) and optimized BigQuery (**~30%** lower query cost).
- 🏅 **XTRAMILE Award** @ Capgemini for automation impact.
